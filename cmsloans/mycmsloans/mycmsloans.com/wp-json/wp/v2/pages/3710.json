We do this by considering your income and debts, your employment and residence situations, your available funds for down payment and required reserves, and some other things. It&#8217;s short and to the point, and we keep the paperwork to a minimum!<\/p>\n<p>Once you qualify, we give you what&#8217;s called a Pre-Qualification Letter (your real estate agent might call it a &#8220;pre-qual&#8221;), which says that we are working with you to find the best loan to meet your needs and that we&#8217;re confident you&#8217;ll qualify for a loan for a certain amount.<\/p>\n<p>When you find a house that catches your eye, and you decide to make an offer, being pre-qualified for a mortgage will do a couple of things. First, it lets you know how much you can offer. Your real estate agent will help you decide on an appropriate offer, but being pre-qualified gives you the confidence to know you can follow through.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, to a home seller, your being pre-qualified is like you walked into their house with a suitcase full of cash to make the deal! They won&#8217;t have to wonder if they&#8217;re wasting their time because you&#8217;ll never qualify for a mortgage to finance the amount you&#8217;re offering for the home. You have the clout of a buyer ready to make the deal right now!<\/p>\n<p>You can always use the calculators available on our site to get an idea of how much mortgage you can afford &#8212; but it&#8217;s important to meet with us. For one thing, you&#8217;ll need a Pre-Qualification Letter! For another thing, we may be able to find a different mortgage program that fits your needs better.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/section><\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":3708,"menu_order":2,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mycmsloans.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3710"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mycmsloans.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mycmsloans.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mycmsloans.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mycmsloans.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3710"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mycmsloans.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3710\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mycmsloans.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3708"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mycmsloans.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3710"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
