The equity built up over years of home mortgage payments can be paid to you. But unlike a traditional home equity loan or second mortgage, no repayment is required until the borrower(s) no longer use the home as their principal residence. HUD&#8217;s reverse mortgage provides these benefits, and it is federally-insured as well.<\/p>\n            <\/div>        <\/div>    <\/div><\/section>\n<section class=\"av_toggle_section\"  itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/CreativeWork\"  >    <div class=\"single_toggle\" data-tags=\"{All} \"  >        <p data-fake-id=\"#toggle-id-2\" class=\"toggler \"  itemprop=\"headline\"    role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-controls=\"toggle-id-2\">Q.

You are further required to receive consumer information from HUD-approved counseling sources prior to obtaining the loan.

The reverse mortgage is different in that it pays you. The amount you can borrow depends on your age, the current interest rate, other loan fees, and the appraised value of your home or FHA&#8217;s mortgage limits for your area, whichever is less. Generally, the more valuable your home is, the older you are, the lower the interest, the more you can borrow. You don&#8217;t make payments, because the loan is not due as long as the house is your principal residence. Like all homeowners, you still are required to pay your real estate taxes and other conventional payments like utilities, but with an FHA-insured HUD Reverse Mortgage, you cannot be foreclosed or forced to vacate your house because you &#8220;missed your mortgage payment.&#8221;<\/p>\n            <\/div>        <\/div>    <\/div><\/section>\n<section class=\"av_toggle_section\"  itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/CreativeWork\"  >    <div class=\"single_toggle\" data-tags=\"{All} \"  >        <p data-fake-id=\"#toggle-id-10\" class=\"toggler \"  itemprop=\"headline\"    role=\"tab\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-controls=\"toggle-id-10\">Q.
